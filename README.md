But wait if you like to use kali linus as GUI in your android device then you need to download a application called VNC viewer after downloading that. just start kali linux in termux and paste that copied text in that and wait for it to install complete linux os in termux. After installation completes just apply this command in kali 
```
```
$ vncserver-start
```
```
Now the server starts on host 127.0.0.1:5901
Now open VNC viewer and click on + icon and create host access

Note:- Don't remove termux from background while using kali linux in VNC viwer beacuse the vnc host files are present in termux app so...
